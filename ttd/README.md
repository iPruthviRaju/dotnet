Test Driven Development:
- It is thought process where we'll write test cases before developing.
- Fail -> Pass -> Refactor

Step 1: Write a test caes and fail it.
Step 2: Put enough code to pass it.
Step 3: Refactor
Step 4: Run test case Pass/Fail -> Step 3

Advantages:
- Intentions are clear, you understand the requirement well.
- Iterative development and testing
- Catching defects early
- Enforce developer to write test cases.
- Documentation
